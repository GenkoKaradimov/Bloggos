# Bloggos
Bloggos is a web server designed to support blogging and digital store functionalities. It provides a versatile platform for managing blog content while integrating e-commerce features for selling products.

I am developing Bloggos with the following goals:
- Showcasing my programming skills through a functional and well-designed product.
- Managing a personal blog focused on technical topics, fulfilling my desire to share knowledge and insights.
- Enhancing my SEO expertise while learning how to effectively distribute content via social networks.
- Monetizing the platform by creating an online store to sell products. As a blog grows, it naturally builds a community with shared interests, creating opportunities for profit.

## Features
The main functionalities of the Bloggos project are outlined below. The implementation process is tailored to my specific needs, and I am not bound to a strict timeline or sequence for completing unfinished tasks. 
My personal instance of this project will be available soon!
1. Article Management: Users can read articles. Articles can be created and edited through the admin panel.
2. Image Management: Admin panel support for adding and editing images.
3. Page Management (Maps): Ability to create and edit pages called "maps," designed to guide users to articles and other related pages.
4. (todo) Navigation Bar Management: Planned functionality for editing the navigation bar directly from the admin panel (to be included in the services section).
5. (todo) E-Shop: Integration of an online store to enable product sales.
6. (todo) User Management: Development of fully functional user management, including authentication and role-based access.
7. (todo) Localization
